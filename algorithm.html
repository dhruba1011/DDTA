      1. Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a specific problem. Key aspects of algorithms include:
Types of Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms: Arrange data in a specific order.
Examples: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.
Searching Algorithms: Find specific elements in a dataset.
Examples: Binary Search, Linear Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Dynamic Programming: Breaks problems into smaller overlapping subproblems.
Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
Greedy Algorithms: Make the best choice at each step.
Examples: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm, Huffman Encoding.
Divide and Conquer: Divide a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them, and combine results.
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.
Backtracking: Explore all possibilities to solve a problem.
Examples: Sudoku Solver, N-Queens Problem, Maze Solver.
Algorithm Complexity
Time Complexity: Measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size.
Common classes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), etc.
Space Complexity: Measures the memory usage of an algorithm.
